# This file exists to prevent regression in the tests. A situation arose in
# which the helm keys were wrong in the e2e tests, resulting in helm receiving
# the default values for image repository and tag. This resulted in false
# positives because the cluster used in the e2e test would pull in the default
# image from a registry.
#
# For all e2e tests using helm, this file should be provided on the command
# line using `helm install -f`. This ensures that the default values are never
# used. The correct values will be supplied by `--set` flags further to the
# right on the command line.
#
# Below, randomized names are used to guarantee that if the wrong helm keys are
# used, the test will fail.
